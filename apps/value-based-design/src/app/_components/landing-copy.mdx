# Drive Business Success with Impactful Design Decisions

**Undervalued. Overlooked. Dispensable. Discarded.**

These are just a few words that describe the pain that many designers are feeling right now.

Tech is at an existential crossroads - *is it threatening or empowering?* â€“ and widespread layoffs bring an added layer of uncertainty to the struggle against burnout.

It&#8217;s easy to feel helpless. But looking at the industry from this perspective isn&#8217;t productive for your job in the short term, and it isn&#8217;t healthy for your career in the long term.

Take a step back. Look at design from a different angle. There is a better way forward for our industry, and it starts with asking why people buy design in the first place.

## Another World is Possible

Designers are good at researching why customers buy products, but the majority of us don&#8217;t perform the same research on our own jobs.

- Why do clients choose to work with us?
- Why do we get hired to practice design?
- What&#8217;s our own purpose?

This research is essential because it helps us understand the value that we bring to the table. It helps us understand how we can be essential to our clients and our companies.

Design isn&#8217;t bought because of trends like crypto, large-language models, or even because our portfolios have a specific aesthetic.

People buy design because **there&#8217;s an expensive problem that needs to be solved** in a way that the designer&#8217;s specific expertise is uniquely suited to solve.

Businesses want to increase profit, lower their costs, and reduce risk.

They will invest in anything that can affect one of those variables. When you are a person who can help them do that, you become valuable to the business.

## Become Essential

By connecting your design decisions to these business objectives, you've made it easy for others to see the impact of your work. You can't be overlooked when the design you produced increases profit at a lower cost to the business.

**This makes you essential.**

When you&#8217;re essential, you'll survive that next round of layoffs. You'll get promoted into a role with more power. You'll find a job that respects you. In short, you will finally pull up that ever-elusive seat at the table that we all keep hearing about.

By rooting your design practice in the generation of value, which we call value-based design, you'll move the business in the right direction and be recognized for your efforts.

## Design with Value in Mind

Design runs much deeper than selecting the right typography, color, and composition of elements on a page. It speaks to the value that people get from the service your business offers.

Your design should increase that value through an iterative, holistic approach.

Value-based design will level up your approach by incorporating elements of customer success, product, interaction design, and user research that are grounded in evidence.

You'll be provided with a framework to research, measure, and experiment with solutions to the problems that your business has today.

When you become a practitioner of value-based design, you&#8217;ll:

- Use your design sense to reliably deliver work that has an impact
- Understand how to ground design decisions in evidence
- Apply the soft skills you need to survive and thrive in any organization
- Accurately measure the impact of your decisions
- Advocate for design in a way that&#8217;s fundamentally impossible to ignore
